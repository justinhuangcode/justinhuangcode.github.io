On May 28, 2020, OpenAI uploaded a 75-page paper to arXiv (a preprint server where researchers can publish papers without waiting for journal peer review): <a href="/papers/Language%20Models%20are%20Few-Shot%20Learners.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</i></a>.

The paper has 31 authors, all from OpenAI. The first author is Tom B. Brown, with notable co-authors including Jared Kaplan (a key researcher behind scaling laws), Alec Radford (the primary designer of GPT-1 and GPT-2), Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist), and Dario Amodei (OpenAI VP of Research).

That author list later fractured into some of the most important AI companies in the world: Dario Amodei and Jared Kaplan left OpenAI to found Anthropic, and Ilya Sutskever later co-founded Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI).

The paper's central claim is straightforward: scale a language model up to 175 billion parameters, and it can complete a wide range of tasks without updating any weights — using just a handful of examples — sometimes approaching the performance of models that were specifically fine-tuned.

This is not task-level fine-tuning. It is the ability to adapt to tasks at inference time with fixed parameters, purely through context. The paper calls this **in-context learning**.

## 1. The Problem

The "pre-train + fine-tune" paradigm established by [BERT](/posts/bert/) was already mainstream by 2020. It worked well, but the paper identified three fundamental issues.

First, every new task still requires a labeled dataset. Labeled data is expensive to collect, and many real-world tasks have no corresponding labeled set at all.

Second, a fine-tuned model's performance on test benchmarks does not necessarily reflect genuine generalization. The model may have simply learned spurious correlations in the training data — scoring high on the benchmark but collapsing under distribution shift.

Third, humans do not learn this way. A human can see one or two examples, hear a natural language instruction, and handle a new task. The NLP systems of that era required thousands of labeled samples to fine-tune for each new task.

The paper's starting point: if a model is large enough, can the knowledge it accumulates during pre-training allow it to directly "read" a task description and a few examples, then produce the answer?

## 2. The Core Idea: No Parameter Updates, Just Prompts

GPT-3's evaluation methodology differed from every large model before it. It defined three settings, none of which involve gradient updates:

**Few-Shot**: give the model a task description plus 10 to 100 examples (the exact number depends on how many fit in the context window), then have it complete a new input. No weight updates, no backpropagation.

**One-Shot**: give just one example. This most closely mirrors how humans learn a new task — someone demonstrates once, and you take it from there.

**Zero-Shot**: no examples at all, just a natural language instruction. This is the hardest setting, but also the most practical — if the model truly "understands" the task itself, it should not need any examples.

```rust
// Rust

/// GPT-3's three evaluation settings — all involve only forward inference, no parameter updates
enum EvalSetting {
    /// Task description only, no examples
    ZeroShot {
        instruction: String,    // "Translate English to French."
        prompt: String,         // "cheese =>"
    },
    /// Task description + one example
    OneShot {
        instruction: String,
        example: (String, String),  // ("sea otter =>", "loutre de mer")
        prompt: String,
    },
    /// Task description + multiple examples (typically 10-100)
    FewShot {
        instruction: String,
        examples: Vec<(String, String)>,  // pack as many as possible into the context window
        prompt: String,
    },
}

fn build_prompt(setting: &EvalSetting) -> String {
    match setting {
        EvalSetting::ZeroShot { instruction, prompt } => {
            format!("{}\n{}", instruction, prompt)
        }
        EvalSetting::OneShot { instruction, example, prompt } => {
            format!("{}\n{} {}\n{}", instruction, example.0, example.1, prompt)
        }
        EvalSetting::FewShot { instruction, examples, prompt } => {
            let mut text = instruction.clone();
            for (input, output) in examples {
                text.push_str(&format!("\n{} {}", input, output));
            }
            text.push_str(&format!("\n{}", prompt));
            text
        }
    }
}
```

The paper calls this capability **in-context learning**: during pre-training, the model implicitly learns patterns for a wide variety of tasks from massive amounts of text; at inference time, examples are concatenated into the context, and the model "recognizes" the current task during the forward pass and completes it. The paper describes this process using the language of "meta-learning" — pre-training is the outer loop, in-context learning is the inner loop.

The distinction from fine-tuning is fundamental. Fine-tuning modifies model parameters to fit a task. In-context learning modifies nothing — the same model, the same weights, switching tasks purely by varying the input text.

## 3. Model Architecture and Scale

GPT-3's architecture is not a new invention. Like GPT-2, it is just the decoder portion of the [Transformer](/posts/attention-is-all-you-need/), stacked layer by layer. The only modification: alternating between dense attention and local banded sparse attention (from Sparse Transformer) within the Transformer layers.

What is genuinely different is the scale. The paper trained 8 models of varying sizes, spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count:

| Model | Parameters | Layers | Hidden Size | Attention Heads |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| GPT-3 Small | 125M | 12 | 768 | 12 |
| GPT-3 Medium | 350M | 24 | 1024 | 16 |
| GPT-3 Large | 760M | 24 | 1536 | 16 |
| GPT-3 XL | 1.3B | 24 | 2048 | 24 |
| GPT-3 2.7B | 2.7B | 32 | 2560 | 32 |
| GPT-3 6.7B | 6.7B | 32 | 4096 | 32 |
| GPT-3 13B | 13B | 40 | 5140 | 40 |
| **GPT-3 175B** | **175B** | **96** | **12288** | **96** |

175 billion parameters, 96 layers, 96 attention heads, hidden dimension of 12288. Context window of 2048 tokens. This scale was unprecedented at the time — over 100 times larger than GPT-2's 1.5 billion parameters.

```rust
// Rust

struct GPT3Config {
    n_params: u64,       // total parameter count
    n_layers: usize,     // number of Transformer layers
    d_model: usize,      // hidden dimension
    n_heads: usize,      // number of attention heads
    d_head: usize,       // dimension per head (d_model / n_heads)
    d_ff: usize,         // feed-forward network dimension (4 * d_model)
    n_ctx: usize,        // context window length
}

fn gpt3_175b() -> GPT3Config {
    GPT3Config {
        n_params: 175_000_000_000,
        n_layers: 96,
        d_model: 12288,
        n_heads: 96,
        d_head: 128,       // 12288 / 96
        d_ff: 49152,       // 12288 * 4
        n_ctx: 2048,
    }
}
```

The purpose of training these models was explicit: to validate scaling laws. Earlier work by Kaplan et al. (one of this paper's co-authors) had already shown a smooth power-law relationship between language model loss and parameter count. GPT-3 pushed that hypothesis to 175 billion parameters to see whether in-context learning ability follows the same pattern.

The answer is yes: the larger the model, the steeper the improvement in few-shot learning. Zero-shot performance rises steadily with scale, and few-shot performance rises even faster. This means larger models are not just "more accurate" — they are also more efficient at leveraging contextual information.

## 4. Training Data

GPT-3 was trained on approximately 300 billion tokens, drawn from five sources:

| Dataset | Tokens | Training Mix |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Common Crawl (filtered) | 410B | ~60% |
| WebText2 | 19B | ~22% |
| Books1 | 12B | ~8% |
| Books2 | 55B | ~8% |
| English Wikipedia | 3B | ~3% |

Note a key detail: the sampling proportions are not proportional to dataset size. Higher-quality datasets (WebText2, Books, Wikipedia) were oversampled — WebText2 was seen 2.9 times during training, Wikipedia 3.4 times, while Common Crawl was not even seen once in full (0.44 epochs). The paper deliberately traded a small amount of overfitting for higher-quality training signal.

The raw Common Crawl data was 45TB. It went through three processing steps: (1) filtering based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora; (2) document-level fuzzy deduplication; (3) mixing in known high-quality datasets for diversity. After filtering, 570GB remained — roughly 410 billion tokens.

All models were trained on V100 GPUs using a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft.

## 5. Experimental Results

The paper evaluated across more than twenty datasets, covering 9 major task categories. Here are several key results.

**Language Modeling**: on Penn Tree Bank, GPT-3 few-shot perplexity (a measure of how "surprised" the model is by text — lower is better) reached 20.50, setting a new record. On LAMBADA (which requires predicting the final word based on long-range context), zero-shot accuracy was 76.2%, few-shot 86.4%, substantially surpassing the previous best.

**Translation**: GPT-3 was never specifically trained for translation, yet on French-to-English, few-shot BLEU score reached 32.6, exceeding the best unsupervised neural machine translation result. However, English-to-French (25.2 BLEU) still lagged significantly behind fine-tuned models. An interesting finding: GPT-3 is noticeably better at translating into English than out of it, directly reflecting the English-heavy composition of its training data.

**Closed-Book QA**: on TriviaQA, few-shot accuracy (exact match) was 71.2%, surpassing fine-tuned models under the same closed-book setting. The model references no documents — it answers purely from knowledge stored in its parameters.

**SuperGLUE**: on this comprehensive benchmark, GPT-3's few-shot performance approached some strong fine-tuned baselines, but still trailed the strongest dedicated fine-tuned systems of the time.

**Synthetic Tasks**: the paper also designed novel tasks specifically to test in-context learning. For example, giving the model a few examples of "made-up words" (defining a nonexistent word and then using it in a sentence), GPT-3 could correctly learn and use the new word. Three-digit addition was nearly 100% accurate in few-shot (two-digit was also near-perfect), but accuracy dropped sharply at four and five digits.

```rust
// Rust

/// The core flow of in-context learning — note that the entire process involves no gradient computation
fn in_context_learning(
    model: &GPT3,
    examples: &[(String, String)],  // a few examples
    query: &str,                     // new input
) -> String {
    // Step 1: concatenate examples and query into a single text sequence
    let mut prompt = String::new();
    for (input, output) in examples {
        prompt.push_str(&format!("{} {}\n", input, output));
    }
    prompt.push_str(query);

    // Step 2: tokenize
    let tokens = tokenize(&prompt);  // BPE tokenization, vocabulary ~50,000

    // Step 3: forward inference, generating token by token
    let mut output_tokens = Vec::new();
    let mut context = tokens;

    loop {
        // Forward pass only — no backpropagation, no parameter updates
        let logits = model.forward(&context);
        let next_token = sample_from(logits.last().unwrap());

        if next_token == EOS_TOKEN {
            break;
        }
        output_tokens.push(next_token);
        context.push(next_token);
    }

    decode(&output_tokens)
}
```

## 6. Data Contamination

The paper devotes substantial space in Section 4 to a thorny issue: overlap between training data and test data.

GPT-3's training data includes vast amounts of internet text, and many test benchmarks are publicly available on the internet. This means the model may have "seen" the test questions during training. The team attempted to remove these overlaps before training, but due to a bug in the processing pipeline, some overlaps were not fully cleaned. Retraining from scratch was too expensive to be practical.

Their approach: for each benchmark, construct a "clean subset" (removing all samples with 13-gram overlaps against the training data), then compare model performance on the full set versus the clean subset. The conclusion: for most benchmarks, contamination had minimal impact on results. However, PIQA and Winograd showed suspicious performance drops, and the paper flagged those results with asterisks.

This level of honesty was quite rare at the time. Most papers avoid discussing data contamination entirely. GPT-3 not only proactively investigated the issue but also developed systematic detection tools. That itself is a contribution to subsequent research.

## 7. Limitations

The paper's discussion of its own limitations in Section 5 is remarkably candid.

**Text Coherence**: GPT-3 still exhibits semantic repetition, self-contradiction, and even nonsensical sentences at the document level. Generation quality is much better than GPT-2, but long-form coherence remains insufficient.

**Commonsense Physics**: GPT-3 performs poorly on commonsense physics questions like "If you put cheese in a refrigerator, will it melt?" It can handle linguistic reasoning, but its understanding of the physical world remains superficial.

**The Cost of Unidirectionality**: as an autoregressive model, GPT-3 can only look left-to-right. The paper acknowledges that on tasks requiring bidirectional context (such as determining whether the same word in two sentences carries the same meaning), GPT-3's few-shot performance falls short of fine-tuned bidirectional models. This indicates that such tasks are not GPT-3's strength under its autoregressive setup; the unidirectional modeling objective introduces a structural bias.

**Sample Efficiency**: GPT-3 saw approximately 300 billion tokens during pre-training, far exceeding the amount of text a human encounters in a lifetime. The paper explicitly notes that even though few-shot learning is efficient at inference time, the data requirements for pre-training remain enormous.

**Inference Cost**: a 175-billion-parameter model is expensive to run and difficult to deploy. The paper mentions distillation (using a large model's outputs to train a smaller model) as a possible direction, but notes it has not yet been attempted at the hundred-billion-parameter scale.

## 8. Societal Impact

The paper dedicates an entire section (Section 6) to societal impact, covering three areas.

**Misuse Risks**: human evaluators could identify GPT-3-generated news articles at only about chance level (~52% accuracy). The stronger the model, the harder its fabricated text is to detect. The team reported that they were monitoring forums and chat groups to track trends in malicious use.

**Bias**: the paper ran extensive experiments testing GPT-3's biases across gender, race, and religion. For example, in occupation-gender association tests, GPT-3 was more likely to associate "nurse" with female and "banker" with male. In religion-sentiment associations, "Islam" co-occurred more frequently with violence-related words. The paper acknowledges these biases originate from the training data but offers no solution.

**Energy Consumption**: training GPT-3 requires massive compute, and the paper cites estimates but does not disclose specific energy figures. However, it points out that once trained, the model can be applied to many different tasks, making it more energy-efficient than training a separate model for each task.

## 9. My Takeaways

After reading this paper, a few things stand out.

First, GPT-3 demonstrated something important: scale can push in-context learning past the usability threshold. A 175-billion-parameter model is not simply "a bigger GPT-2" — its in-context learning performance exceeds smaller models by an order of magnitude. The model completes new tasks with no parameter updates, relying solely on a few examples in the context. This capability was not explicitly hand-designed; it emerged gradually as scale increased, and only at GPT-3's scale did it become clear and practical enough to matter. BERT proved the value of pre-training. GPT-3 proved the value of scale.

Second, the paper's writing approach is worth noting. 31 authors, 75 pages, deploying a massive number of experiments to answer a simple question: are larger models better at leveraging a few examples? They did not shy away from limitations — text coherence, commonsense reasoning, data contamination, bias — all discussed head-on. That level of rigor has, ironically, become increasingly rare in later large model papers.

Third, this paper's author list reads like a history of the AI industry's fracturing. Dario Amodei and Jared Kaplan later founded Anthropic (the company behind Claude), and Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI to co-found SSI. In 2020, these people were still on the same team co-authoring a paper; within two years, they had diverged in different directions. The paper's discussion of societal impact and safety risks may well have been a foreshadowing of those later disagreements.

Fourth, from a technical evolution standpoint, GPT-3 marks the turning point from "pre-train + fine-tune" to "pre-train + prompt." BERT's approach was: learn general knowledge first, then fine-tune parameters for each task. GPT-3 said: if the model is large enough, the fine-tuning step can be skipped — just tell the model in natural language what you want it to do. This idea later evolved into the core interaction paradigm of products like ChatGPT and Claude: the user asks a question in natural language, and the model answers directly.

From Seq2Seq's encode-decode, to [Bahdanau attention](/posts/neural-machine-translation-by-jointly-learning-to-align-and-translate/)'s "where to look," to the [Transformer](/posts/attention-is-all-you-need/)'s "look everywhere at once," to [BERT](/posts/bert/)'s "learn first, then fine-tune," to GPT-3's "scale up until fine-tuning is unnecessary" — each step reduced the need for human intervention and increased the model's ability to handle tasks on its own.

GPT-3 is not the endpoint. But it was the first time people seriously considered a question: if we keep making models bigger, what else will emerge?

The answer to that question is everything that came after.
